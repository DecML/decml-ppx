decml - An experimental library for transparent parameter management
of machine learning models, via abductive decoupling.
==========================================================================================================================

DecML is an experimental library for achieving a decoupling between a
supervised machine learning model and its parameters. Models are defined in a
custom ppx syntax, with the DecML extension managing the decoupling itself.
The library also defines several modules for utility functions.

See the file [INSTALL.txt](INSTALL.txt) for building and installation
instructions.
