An experimental library for transparent parameter management
of machine learning models, via abductive decoupling.

DecML is an experimental library for achieving a decoupling between a
supervised machine learning model and its parameters. Models are
defined in a custom ppx syntax, with the DecML extension managing the
decoupling itself. The library also defines several modules for
utility functions.
